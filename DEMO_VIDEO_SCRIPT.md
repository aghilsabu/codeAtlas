## 🎥 Video Structure

### **INTRO (15 seconds)**

**[Screen: Title card or app landing page]**

> "Ever tried to understand a new codebase and felt completely lost? 
> 
> Meet CodeAtlas — an AI-powered tool that turns any GitHub repository into beautiful architecture diagrams, with voice explanations and interactive chat.
>
> Let me show you how it works."

---

### **SECTION 1: Analyze a Repository (45 seconds)**

**[Screen: Generate page]**

> "Start by pasting any GitHub URL. I'll use the Gradio repository as an example."

**[Action: Paste `https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio` and click Generate]**

> "CodeAtlas downloads the repository, filters out irrelevant files like node_modules and tests, and uses Google Gemini to analyze the code structure."

**[Screen: Show loading indicator, then diagram appearing]**

> "In seconds, you get a professional architecture diagram showing the main components, their relationships, and how data flows through the system."

---

### **SECTION 2: Explore the Diagram (30 seconds)**

**[Screen: Explore page with diagram]**

> "The diagram is fully interactive. You can adjust the layout direction..."

**[Action: Change layout dropdown - TB to LR]**

> "...modify spacing between nodes..."

**[Action: Adjust rank/node separation sliders]**

> "...and zoom in on specific areas."

**[Action: Use zoom slider]**

> "Every diagram is saved to history, so you can revisit previous analyses anytime."

**[Action: Show history panel briefly]**

---

### **SECTION 3: Voice Narration (25 seconds)**

**[Screen: Voice section in sidebar]**

> "But here's where it gets really cool. Click the voice button, and CodeAtlas generates a natural audio explanation of the architecture."

**[Action: Click Generate Voice / Play audio]**

> "Powered by ElevenLabs, it's like having a senior engineer walk you through the codebase."

**[Let audio play for 5-10 seconds as example]**

---

### **SECTION 4: AI Chat (25 seconds)**

**[Screen: Chat panel]**

> "Have questions? The AI chat knows everything about the codebase you just analyzed."

**[Action: Type a question like "What is the main entry point of this application?"]**

> "Ask about specific files, design patterns, or how components connect."

**[Show AI response appearing]**

> "It's context-aware and remembers your conversation."

---

### **SECTION 5: MCP Integration (20 seconds)**

**[Screen: Settings page or MCP endpoint]**

> "CodeAtlas is also an MCP server, meaning AI assistants like Claude can use it directly."

**[Action: Show MCP endpoint URL or badge]**

> "Four tools are exposed: analyze codebase, get architecture summary, chat with code, and list recent analyses."

> "Connect it to Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client."

---

### **OUTRO (15 seconds)**

**[Screen: App main page or GitHub repo]**

> "CodeAtlas — understand any codebase in seconds, not hours.
>
> Try it free on HuggingFace Spaces, or check out the GitHub repo.
>
> Built for the MCP 1st Birthday Hackathon. Thanks for watching!"

## 🎙️ Voiceover Tips

1. **Pace:** Speak slightly slower than normal conversation
2. **Energy:** Enthusiastic but not over the top
3. **Pauses:** Leave 1-2 second gaps between sections for editing
4. **Mistakes:** Don't restart — just pause and repeat the line (edit later)

---

## ✂️ Editing Notes

- Add subtle background music (royalty-free, low volume)
- Use zoom-in effects on key UI elements
- Add text overlays for important URLs
- Include captions/subtitles if possible
- Export at 1080p, 30fps minimum

---

## 📤 Upload Checklist

1. **YouTube:** Upload as unlisted or public
2. **GitHub:** Drag video into a GitHub issue to get embed URL
3. **README:** Update video placeholder with actual URL
4. **Thumbnail:** Create eye-catching thumbnail with app screenshot
